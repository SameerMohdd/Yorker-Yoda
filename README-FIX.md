# Yorker Yoda - Fix for Upcoming Matches Issue

This document explains the issue with the "No upcoming matches" display in the Yorker Yoda application and provides solutions to fix it.

## The Issue

When opening the Yorker Yoda application, the "Upcoming Matches" section appears empty even though there are matches scheduled for the future. This is due to a few issues:

1. Problems with date comparison in the `getUpcomingMatches` function
2. Errors in team logo paths
3. Lack of error handling for unexpected data formats
4. Missing fallback mechanisms when data isn't available

## Files Created to Fix the Issue

We've created several new files to help fix the problem:

1. `js/match-helper.js` - Contains improved functions to fix the upcoming matches display
2. `fix-instructions.html` - Instructions for implementing the fix
3. `test-fix.html` - A test page to demonstrate and verify the fix
4. `README-FIX.md` - This documentation file

## How to Apply the Fix

### Method 1: Add the match-helper.js Script

1. Open your `index.html` file
2. Find the section near the bottom where JavaScript files are included
3. Add the following line after the data-integration.js script:

```html
<script src="js/match-helper.js"></script>
```

4. Save the file and reload the application in your browser

### Method 2: Use the Test Fix Page

1. Open `test-fix.html` in your browser
2. Click the "Apply All Fixes" button
3. Verify that the upcoming matches and points table are displayed correctly

## What's Been Fixed

The `match-helper.js` file includes the following improvements:

1. **Improved Date Comparison**: Better handling of date parsing and comparison to correctly identify future matches
2. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to prevent display issues when data is missing or malformed
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Uses hardcoded data when dynamic data isn't available
4. **Dynamic Loading**: Shows loading indicators during data processing
5. **Automatic Fix**: Automatically applies fixes when display issues are detected
6. **Points Table**: Added a new points table display in the Analysis Breakdown section
7. **Better Logo Handling**: Improved handling of team logos with proper error cases

## Debug Mode

For troubleshooting, you can enable debug mode by adding `?debug=true` to the URL:

```
http://localhost:8080/index.html?debug=true
```

This will display a debug console with detailed information about data loading and processing.
